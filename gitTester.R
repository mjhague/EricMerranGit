#Ok - so I signed up! Because I did not have "write access" to this file it has created a fork for me to commit my proposed changes to. Once I submit
#a change it says it will write to a new branch in the fork and then I can send a pull request. Let's try it out!

# Hey Merran, I thought we could test out using GIT together with this script. I will send you a
# link on GitHub.
# This can be a longer term/slow project but I though it would be fun to test.

# I will create a repo on GitHub with this file. I beleive you will need to make a "pull request"
# This would result in your downloading the file. Make some changes (i.e. respond to this message)
# Then I think you somehow submit your changes and I would accept them.

# This is a change I am making prior to inviting you to the repo

# I think I broke something already

# Never mind I didn't!
